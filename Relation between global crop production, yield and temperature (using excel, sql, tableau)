Relation between global crop production, yield and temperature (using excel, sql, tableau)

The aim of this project is to showcase the skills learned by asking SMART questions, structured thinking, data management, data cleaning, data analysis & data visualization.
About the Project
Here we are going to see the relation between global crop production, crop yield, crop production in hectares of land and global temperature from 1900 – 2017

Twentieth Century Crop Statistics, v1 (1900 – 2017)

Data collected from SOCIOECONOMIC DATA AND APPLICATIONS CENTER (SEDAC) A Data Center in NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) — Hosted by CIESIN at Columbia University
 https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/food-twentieth-century-crop-statistics-1900-2017
This document outlines the methodology and data sets used to construct the Twentieth Century Crop Statistics, 1900-2017, and consists of national or subnational maize and wheat production, yield, and harvested area statistics for all available years from 1900- 2017.
Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data
Global land temperature data collected from kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
Here it contains
Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):
•	Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
•	LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
•	LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average


Process
In the process phase is where we create and transform data but still maintaning its integrity. It is also where we test & validate data that can help us determine which data fields to clean if necessary
In this phase is where I:
•	Data is collected in excel and done possible cleaning here itself
•	used Microsoft SQL server management studio as an analysis tool, since it processes data faster compared to spreadsheets for big datasets.
•	checked for data integrity by running different queries across field names that would help me in data cleaning.
•	transformed data by adding and updating those columns that will add other categories to group user types even more to uncover patterns or give more context.
•	verified and documented data cleaning results.
Data Cleaning and Manipulation Documentation
Data manipulation Using Spreadsheet
As there are many sheets and I decided to take only important sheets and renamed the sheets that I am using.
Data validation using SQL (BigQuery)
After collecting necessary sheets I have imported data to SQL using Import data function.
Here I
1.	Checked for NULL values for each column / data field.
2.	Checked for duplicate entries.
3.	Checked for misspelled words for columns with STRING as its data type.
4.	Checked for trailing & leading spaces on STRING values
5.	Checked for data types that are used
Commands used: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, COUNT, IS NULL, OR & LIKE

Now two tables are prepared as Crops_Table and temperature
Joining the two table where country is common to find the relation between temperature and crops
--Joining the two tables using join on country column from 2 tables
--and creating crops_vs_Temp table

SELECT temperature.Country, Crops_Table.crop, temperature.Avg_Temp, temperature.Count_Year, Crops_Table.Avg_production, Crops_Table.Avg_yield
into Crop_vs_Temp FROM Crops_Table
JOIN temperature
ON Crops_Table.country = temperature.Country

Analysis
Here we created new table as Crop_vs_Temp from joining two tables Crops_Table and temperature which contains country, crop, Avg_Temp, Count_Year, Avg_production, Avg_yield as columns.
By using these we can find relation between temperature, crop production and crop yield of major countries from 1900 – 2017
And also we can separately analyze the statistics of crop production, land used, and crop yield of different countries by using visualizations
And also we can analyze average temperature and temperature uncertainty globally by using viz.

Data visualization

In this phase is where I:
•	used Tableau as a tool that will create effective & compelling data viz  


Average production of major countries across the world and difference between crops production from 1900 to 2017
